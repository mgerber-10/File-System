# WAD-File-System

Developed a library to read a WAD (Whereâ€™s All the Data) file  which is a standard in a number of classic PC games, such as DOOM. Then a directory/file structure was created from the WAD file. Implemented a userspace daemon (via FUSE API) to access the directory structure once mounted. Tested implementation by navigating the mounted directory and examining the names and file contents.
